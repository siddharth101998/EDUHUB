**Explanation of key components**

*   `eduhub/`: This is the main Django project directory. It contains the core settings and configuration files for your project.
    *   `settings.py`:  Configure database connections, installed apps, static files, templates, and other project-wide settings.
    *   `urls.py`: Define the URL patterns for your project and map them to corresponding views.
*   `app/`: This is a Django app directory. You can have multiple apps within a project to organize your code into logical units.
    *   `models.py`: Define your database models, which represent the structure of your data (e.g., User, Course, Quiz, etc.).
    *   `views.py`: Write the logic for handling HTTP requests, interacting with models, and rendering templates.
    *   `forms.py`: Create forms to handle user input (e.g., login form, signup form, quiz form).
*   `static/`: Store your static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) that are not dynamically generated.
*   `templates/`: Store your HTML templates, which are used to render the structure and content of your web pages.
    *   `base.html`: A common base template that can be extended by other templates to include shared elements like the navbar and footer.
*   `media/`: This directory is used to store user-uploaded files (if your application allows file uploads).
*   `requirements.txt`: List the Python packages required for your project. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.
*   `README.md`: The project description file that we created earlier.

This structure provides a good starting point for organizing your EduHub project. You can adapt it as your project grows and becomes more complex. For example, you might add more apps, create subdirectories within `static/` and `templates/` to further organize your files, or introduce a `tests/` directory for more comprehensive testing.
